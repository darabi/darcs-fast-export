There are two branches in this repo which will be probably never merged
to master, but they may be interesting.

The 'deleteall' branch makes d-f-e use the deleteall command in the
fast-import stream. I did it for testing purposes, using it in a
production environment is not efficient.

The 'show' branch implements a way to avoid any working directory, it
replaces 'darcs apply' calls with 'darcs show contents' ones - which is
quite elegant but three times slower.
